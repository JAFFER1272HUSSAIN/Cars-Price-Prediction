# 🚗 Car Price Prediction - Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models  

### 📌 Overview  
The **Car Price Prediction** project is a **Machine Learning & Deep Learning-based model** developed during my **5th semester** as part of a **conference paper**. The objective of this project is to **analyze car price trends** and develop a **predictive model** that estimates car prices based on various features like **brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, engine capacity, etc.**  

### 🎯 Features  
- 📊 **Data Collection & Preprocessing** (Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical data)  
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (Statistical insights & visualization)  
- 🤖 **Model Training & Evaluation** (Multiple ML & DL models for price prediction)  
- 🔬 **Comparison of ML & DL Algorithms** (Performance evaluation & accuracy metrics)  
- 📈 **Hyperparameter Tuning** (Optimizing models for better accuracy)  
- 📂 **Dataset Included** (Raw & preprocessed dataset)
